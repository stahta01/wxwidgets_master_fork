Building wxGTK port with Win32 GDK backend
------------------------------------------

GTK+ widget toolkit has multiple GDK backends and one of them is Win32.
It is a wrapper around Windows API.

See https://www.gtk.org/download/windows.php

These notes don't consider building wxGTK with X11 backend under Windows.

Building steps:

1. wxGTK/Win32 build is similar to wxMSW one and you should have configured
and be able to build wxWidgets as described in docs/msw/install.txt

2. wxGTK/Win32 is disabled by default in wxWidgets, you need to enable it
in bakefiles manually. Apply following patch manually or using Cygwin:

    patch -p0 < docs/msw/gtkfix-mingw_only.patch

Regenerate required make/project files:
    cd build/bakefiles
    bakefile_gen
    cd ../..

3. Download GTK+ for Windows and uncompress files in the directory
without spaces in the name. We suppose later that GTK+/Win32 is
in the C:\gtk directory.

4. Building with MinGW

    set PATH=%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%
    set PATH=C:\Apps32\MingwGCC510TDMmgw32\bin;%PATH%
    set PATH=C:\gtk\bin\;%PATH%;

    set CFLAGS=-IC:\gtk\include\gtk-2.0
    set CFLAGS=%CFLAGS% -IC:\gtk\include\glib-2.0
    set CFLAGS=%CFLAGS% -IC:\gtk\include\cairo
    set CFLAGS=%CFLAGS% -IC:\gtk\include\pango-1.0
    set CFLAGS=%CFLAGS% -IC:\gtk\include\gdk-pixbuf-2.0
    set CFLAGS=%CFLAGS% -IC:\gtk\include\atk-1.0
    set CFLAGS=%CFLAGS% -IC:\gtk\lib\glib-2.0\include
    set CFLAGS=%CFLAGS% -IC:\gtk\lib\gtk-2.0\include

    set CXXFLAGS=%CFLAGS%
    set LDFLAGS=-LC:\gtk\lib

    cd build/msw

    mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc TOOLKIT=GTK TOOLKIT_VERSION=2

    cd ../..

cd samples/minimal

mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc TOOLKIT=GTK TOOLKIT_VERSION=2

5. Now you can use wxGTK/Win32 as wxMSW in your applications.
